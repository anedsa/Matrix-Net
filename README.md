# 📦 Matrix‑Net  
**Recipe‑Based Decentralized Web**

A proof‑of‑concept platform where files are **not stored as raw bytes** but as tiny JSON *recipes* that point to a shared, immutable **Matrix** of public data blocks. By reconstructing content from this global matrix, Matrix‑Net achieves ultra‑compressed, censorship‑resistant distribution and enables offline browsing with only a few kilobytes per file.

> “I’ve opened a GitHub repository where we can build Matrix‑Net together with the community—please join the discussion, file issues, and submit pull‑requests!”

## What is Matrix‑Net?

Instead of sending the raw bytes of a file, **Matrix‑Net**:

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1️⃣ The Matrix** | A single global data set built once from publicly licensed sources (Wikipedia dumps, GitHub archives, Project Gutenberg, open‑access media, etc.). |
| **2️⃣ Recipes** | Any new file is encoded as a JSON *recipe* that maps each 4 KB chunk of the original file to a block in the Matrix plus an optional tiny transformation (e.g., XOR mask). |
| **3️⃣ Reconstruction** | A peer that already holds the Matrix can rebuild the original file locally, even when offline. |

Result: **massively compressed distribution**, permanent availability (as long as the Matrix lives), and strong resistance to censorship or “seed‑less” disappearance.

---

## Key Features

- **Hyper‑compressed distribution** – recipes are usually only a few KB regardless of the source size.  
- **Censorship‑resistant & permanent** – any recipe can be resurrected forever as long as the Matrix exists somewhere.  
- **Offline browsing** – with a local copy of the Matrix you can reconstruct linked content without ever touching the network.  
- **Deterministic reconstruction** – same recipe + same matrix → identical output byte‑for‑byte.  
- **Extensible transformation layer** – currently XOR masks; future versions may support delta‑coding, byte‑reordering, or custom reversible ops.

## Why this repo exists

* To gather ideas, design sketches, and research on how such a system could be built.  
* To provide a central place for collaboration (specs, benchmarks, prototypes, discussions).  
* To keep track of progress toward an open‑source implementation that anyone can run.

> **There is no production code yet** – the repository is intentionally empty aside from documentation so the community can decide how to structure it together.

## Vision in a nutshell

1. **The Matrix** – a one‑time generated, static collection of small (≈4 KB) data blocks drawn exclusively from freely licensed sources.  
2. **Recipes** – tiny JSON manifests that map each chunk of a target file to a block in the Matrix plus an optional reversible transformation (e.g., XOR mask). A recipe for a multi‑gigabyte file is still only a few kilobytes.  
3. **Reconstruction** – any peer that already stores the Matrix can recreate the original file locally, even while offline, simply by applying the transformations described in the recipe.

*Result*: massively compressed distribution, permanent availability, and strong resistance to censorship or “seed‑less” disappearance.

## How you can help right now

| Area | What we need | How to get involved |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Concept & Design** | Formalize the data model, transformation format, indexing strategy, security analysis. | Open an *Issue* with a design proposal or comment on existing threads in **Discussions**. |
| **Prototype Architecture** | Choose a language/framework for a first‑pass encoder/decoder (Rust, Go, Python, etc.) and sketch module boundaries (matrix builder, recipe generator, decoder). | Start a *Discussion* titled “Prototype language choice” and vote. |
| **Matrix Construction Strategy** | Define source datasets, chunk size, deduplication algorithm, hash table layout, storage format. | Create an issue “Matrix generation plan” and contribute ideas or sample scripts. |
| **Nearest‑Neighbour Search** | Research fast approximate‑matching techniques (LSH, product quantization, GPU brute force). | Share papers/links in a discussion; propose a small benchmark repo. |
| **Testing & Benchmarks** | Design metrics for compression ratio, encoding time, lookup latency, storage overhead. | Draft a `benchmarks.md` file and ask for community feedback. |
| **Documentation / Community Building** | Write clear READMEs, design docs, contribution guidelines, code of conduct. | Fork the repo, edit the markdown files, and submit PRs (even if they only contain text). |
| **Funding / Infrastructure** | Help obtain storage for the full Matrix (~1 TB) and a small CDN/seed network. | Post in the “Funding & Resources” discussion; suggest grant programs or sponsors. |

*All contributions—ideas, comments, sketches, pull‑requests that add documentation—are welcome.*

## How to contribute
Matrix‑Net is still a conceptual project, and it needs a small, dedicated team to turn the ideas into reality. If you’re interested in helping manage the repository, coordinate development, or take on a defined role (e.g., Lead Maintainer, Documentation Champion, Community Manager), read on.

|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lead Maintainer**        | Sets technical direction, merges PRs, reviews design proposals, ensures the repo stays consistent.                     |
| **Documentation Champion**| Keeps `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and all design docs up‑to‑date; writes tutorials and onboarding material.      |
| **Community Manager**      | Runs GitHub Discussions, moderates Discord, welcomes new contributors, tracks issue triage.                           |
| **Build & CI Engineer**    | Configures GitHub Actions/workflows, maintains test suites, ensures reproducible builds across platforms.            |
| **Research Lead**          | Explores matrix generation, nearest‑neighbour algorithms, and transformation schemes; publishes findings in `docs/`. |

*You can volunteer for one role or wear multiple hats – the team will stay flexible as the project evolves.*

## Roadmap (high‑level)

| Phase | Goal |
|-------|------|
| **0 – Community Foundations** | Gather design proposals, decide on core data structures, set contribution workflow. |
| **1 – Matrix Prototype** | Build a small (~10 GB) sample matrix from public datasets; publish generation scripts. |
| **2 – Recipe Encoder (Exact‑Match)** | Simple CLI that maps file chunks to exact matches in the sample matrix and outputs JSON recipes. |
| **3 – Approximate Matching & Transform Layer** | Add nearest‑neighbour search + XOR‑mask transformation for high‑entropy data. |
| **4 – Decoder / Reconstruction Tool** | Verify lossless reconstruction from recipes using only the matrix. |
| **5 – Peer‑to‑Peer Sync** | Prototype a minimal P2P layer (e.g., libp2p, IPFS) to exchange recipes and missing matrix blocks. |
| **6 – Full‑Scale Matrix (~1 TB)** | Scale generation pipeline, publish download mirrors or seed torrents. |
| **7 – Public Beta & Documentation** | Release stable binaries, write user guides, open the project for broader adoption. |

Milestones will be refined as community feedback arrives.
