# Matrix-Net
A proof‑of‑concept platform where files are stored not as raw bytes but as tiny JSON “recipes” that point to a shared, immutable Matrix of public data blocks. By reconstructing content from this global matrix, MatrixNet achieves ultra‑compressed, censorship‑resistant distribution and enables offline browsing with only a few kilobytes per file.

**Recipe‑Based Decentralized Web**

A proof‑of‑concept platform that stores files as tiny *recipes* which reference a shared, immutable **Matrix** of public data blocks. By reconstructing content from this global matrix we achieve ultra‑compressed, censorship‑resistant distribution and enable offline browsing with only a few kilobytes per file.


## What is MatrixNet?

Instead of sending the raw bytes of a file, **MatrixNet**:

1. **Shares a single global data set** – the *Matrix* – built once from publicly licensed sources (Wikipedia dumps, GitHub archives, Project Gutenberg, etc.).  
2. Encodes any new file as a **Recipe** (JSON) that maps each 4 KB chunk of the original file to a block in the Matrix plus an optional tiny transformation (e.g., XOR mask).  
3. Allows any peer that already holds the Matrix to reconstruct the original file locally, even when offline.

## Key Features

- **Hyper‑compressed distribution** – recipes are usually only a few KB regardless of original size.  
- **Censorship‑resistant & permanent** – as long as the Matrix exists somewhere, any recipe can be resurrected forever.  
- **Offline browsing** – with a local copy of the Matrix you can reconstruct any linked content without ever touching the network.  
- **Deterministic reconstruction** – same recipe + same matrix → identical output byte‑for‑byte.  
- **Extensible transformation layer** – currently XOR masks; future versions may support delta‑coding, byte‑reordering, or custom reversible ops.

Why this repo exists
To gather ideas, design sketches, and research on how such a system could be built.
To provide a central place for collaboration (specs, benchmarks, prototypes, discussions).
To keep track of progress toward an open‑source implementation that anyone can run.
There is no production code yet—the repository is intentionally empty aside from documentation so the community can decide how to structure it together.

Vision in a nutshell
The Matrix – A one‑time generated, static collection of small (≈4 KB) data blocks drawn exclusively from freely licensed sources (Wikipedia dumps, GitHub public repos, Project Gutenberg, open‑access media, etc.).
Recipes – Tiny JSON manifests that map each chunk of a target file to a block in the Matrix plus an optional reversible transformation (e.g., XOR mask). A recipe for a multi‑gigabyte file is still only a few kilobytes.
Reconstruction – Any peer that already stores the Matrix can recreate the original file locally, even while offline, simply by applying the transformations described in the recipe.
Result: massively compressed distribution, permanent availability (as long as the Matrix lives), and strong resistance to censorship or “seed‑less” disappearance.

How you can help right now
Area	What we need	How to get involved
Concept & Design	Formalize the data model, transformation format, indexing strategy, security analysis.	Open an Issue with a design proposal or comment on existing design threads in Discussions.
Prototype Architecture	Choose a language/framework for a first‑pass encoder/decoder (Rust, Go, Python, etc.). Sketch module boundaries (matrix builder, recipe generator, decoder).	Submit a Discussion titled “Prototype language choice” and vote.
Matrix Construction Strategy	Define the source datasets, chunk size, deduplication algorithm, hash table layout, storage format.	Create an issue “Matrix generation plan” and contribute ideas or sample scripts.
Nearest‑Neighbour Search	Research fast approximate‑matching techniques (LSH, product quantization, GPU brute force).	Share papers/links in a discussion; propose a small benchmark repo.
Testing & Benchmarks	Design metrics for compression ratio, encoding time, lookup latency, storage overhead.	Draft a benchmarks.md file and ask for community feedback.
Documentation / Community Building	Write clear READMEs, design docs, contribution guidelines, code of conduct.	Fork the repo, edit the markdown files, and submit PRs (even if they only contain text).
Funding / Infrastructure	Help obtain storage for the full Matrix (≈1 TB) and a small CDN/seed network.	Post in the “Funding & Resources” discussion; suggest grant programs or sponsors.
All contributions—ideas, comments, sketches, pull‑requests that add documentation—are welcome.

Roadmap (high‑level)
Phase	Goal
0 – Community Foundations	Gather design proposals, decide on core data structures, set contribution workflow.
1 – Matrix Prototype	Build a small (~10 GB) sample matrix from public datasets; publish generation scripts.
2 – Recipe Encoder (Exact‑Match)	Simple CLI that maps file chunks to exact matches in the sample matrix and outputs JSON recipes.
3 – Approximate Matching & Transform Layer	Add nearest‑neighbour search + XOR‑mask transformation for high‑entropy data.
4 – Decoder / Reconstruction Tool	Verify lossless reconstruction from recipes using only the matrix.
5 – Peer‑to‑Peer Sync	Prototype a minimal P2P layer (e.g., libp2p, IPFS) to exchange recipes and missing matrix blocks.
6 – Full‑Scale Matrix (~1 TB)	Scale generation pipeline, publish download mirrors or seed torrents.
7 – Public Beta & Documentation	Release stable binaries, write user guides, open the project for broader adoption.
Milestones will be refined as community feedback arrives.
