# Matrix-Net
A proof‑of‑concept platform where files are stored not as raw bytes but as tiny JSON “recipes” that point to a shared, immutable Matrix of public data blocks. By reconstructing content from this global matrix, MatrixNet achieves ultra‑compressed, censorship‑resistant distribution and enables offline browsing with only a few kilobytes per file.

**Recipe‑Based Decentralized Web**

A proof‑of‑concept platform that stores files as tiny *recipes* which reference a shared, immutable **Matrix** of public data blocks. By reconstructing content from this global matrix we achieve ultra‑compressed, censorship‑resistant distribution and enable offline browsing with only a few kilobytes per file.

## What is MatrixNet?

Instead of sending the raw bytes of a file, **MatrixNet**:

1. **Shares a single global data set** – the *Matrix* – built once from publicly licensed sources (Wikipedia dumps, GitHub archives, Project Gutenberg, etc.).  
2. Encodes any new file as a **Recipe** (JSON) that maps each 4 KB chunk of the original file to a block in the Matrix plus an optional tiny transformation (e.g., XOR mask).  
3. Allows any peer that already holds the Matrix to reconstruct the original file locally, even when offline.

> *“I’ve opened a GitHub repository where we can **build MatrixNet together** with the community—please join the discussion, file issues, and submit pull‑requests!”*

## Key Features

- **Hyper‑compressed distribution** – recipes are usually only a few KB regardless of original size.  
- **Censorship‑resistant & permanent** – as long as the Matrix exists somewhere, any recipe can be resurrected forever.  
- **Offline browsing** – with a local copy of the Matrix you can reconstruct any linked content without ever touching the network.  
- **Deterministic reconstruction** – same recipe + same matrix → identical output byte‑for‑byte.  
- **Extensible transformation layer** – currently XOR masks; future versions may support delta‑coding, byte‑reordering, or custom reversible ops.

## Quick Start

> The following steps assume you have a recent Rust toolchain (`cargo`) installed. Replace `rust` with another language’s build commands if you prefer to re‑implement the core.

```bash
# 1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MatrixNet.git
cd MatrixNet

# 2️⃣ Build the tools (release mode)
cargo build --release

# 3️⃣ Obtain a Matrix snapshot
#    For testing we provide a 10 GB sample; replace with the full ~1 TB set later.
wget https://example.com/matrix/sample_matrix_10gb.bin -O matrix.bin

# 4️⃣ Encode a file into a recipe
./target/release/recipe_encoder encode \
    --matrix matrix.bin \
    --input path/to/bigfile.iso \
    --output bigfile.recipe.json

# 5️⃣ Decode the file (requires the same Matrix)
./target/release/recipe_decoder decode \
    --matrix matrix.bin \
    --recipe bigfile.recipe.json \
    --output reconstructed.iso
```

### Running the CI locally  
```bash
cargo test --all
```

## How It Works (high‑level)

1. **Matrix Generation** (`matrix_builder`)  
   - Crawl public, permissively‑licensed sources.  
   - Chunk every source into 4 KB blocks.  
   - Deduplicate → store each unique block once.  
   - Build a fast hash
