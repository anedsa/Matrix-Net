# Matrix-Net
A proof‑of‑concept platform where files are stored not as raw bytes but as tiny JSON “recipes” that point to a shared, immutable Matrix of public data blocks. By reconstructing content from this global matrix, MatrixNet achieves ultra‑compressed, censorship‑resistant distribution and enables offline browsing with only a few kilobytes per file.
